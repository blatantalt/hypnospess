okay but like, do the climax for real tho

	select genitals that can climax validly
	pick valid partners to do a climax with
	pick a valid container to do a climax into
	check to see if you can touch yourself

things genitals must do:
initialize
manage their arousal level?? //why is this not handled by the arousal stuff???	
	check if it is exposed
toggle its own visibility
modify its own size
	Update its own size?? but the method does nothing and just returns
update appearance?? (but it literally just makes your boner go away if you're dead)


toggle visibility verb
toggle displayed arousal verb

bonus round: why the fuck is lactation tied to arousal?
proposed solution to this bullshit: new genital subtypes! 
	fluid holding (balls, tits): simply holds reagents, renders
	fluid ejecting (cock, nips): can pull from any reagent holding genital in theory, allowing for some interesting stuff. renders
	hole (vag, sheath, anus, womb): it's a hole, it might display, it might not.
	lump (prostate): it's just a pleasure button

	holes can store 1 small-medium sized item
		faster reagent metabolism through them (rate controlled through var)
		come in regular and "deep" varieties, it takes longer to put in/get out an item from a deep hole

	fluid holding holds a reagent or mixture of reagents (in a ratio)
	thats it thats all they do

	ejecting links to a holding and releases it based on specific situations defined in the specific one
